            <br/>
            <strong>Public SSH Key Submition</strong>
            <p>
                Used to submit user's Public Key to the server for SSH Security. <br/>
                This is used if you want to use the Git CLI instead of the GUI. <br/>
                If you know how to use the CLI, then you know how to generate an SSH Key <br/>
            </p>

            <br/>
            <strong>Create/List Repositories</strong>
            <p>
                Repositories should <strong>NOT</strong> have any white-space (Spaces). <br/>
                White-Spaces will be automatically removed. <br/>
                Creating a Repository is simple, just type the Repository Name and press Create. <br/>
                Listing a Repository occurs automatically at site launch or at repository creation. <br/>
                Manually Listing the Repository refreshes the list to the latest Available Repositories. <br/>
            </p>

            <br/>
            <strong>Obtaining Repository URLs</strong>
            <p>
                Simply click on the Repository from the List to obtain the URL for the Repository. <br/>
            </p>

            <br/>
            <strong>Using the Repository</strong>
            <p>
                Download the Git GUI from Git's official site <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Here</a>. <br/>
                Follow the installation process. <br/>
                Open up the Git GUI that was installed and clone the repository, giving the Repository URL from the List. <br/>
                You are required to know the Server's git Password, which you will use to modify the Repository. <br/>
                You are now all set to using the Git Server. <br/>
